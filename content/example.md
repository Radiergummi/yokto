##What is this?

This is an example markup file which will be parsed for the article with slug *example*.
You can use the whole markup stuff here, at least that's what it will be when it is ready ;)

It works like so: The system looks for files using `PATH . 'content' . DS . $route['slug'] . '.md'`
Example: For `www.example.com/this-is-a-post` it looks for `<base>/content/this-is-a-post.md`
